# A haskell.nix module pointing a project's builds at the compiler's own C
# toolchain. The components of a cross project are built by the cross package
# set's stdenv, whose toolchain is not the one the compiler was configured
# with, so anything reaching for C during a build looks in the wrong sysroot:
# `Setup configure`'s foreign-dependency checks fail on headers that are
# present, and what does compile is built for a different ABI than the
# compiler's own libraries.
#
# The module goes into every project the driver builds, including the ones for
# the build platform, and decides per evaluation whether it applies: only a
# platform with an entry of its own, carrying a toolchain, is affected.
#
# Example:
#
#   import ./compiler-toolchain.nix { inherit lib compilers; }
#   => a haskell.nix module which, in the project whose target has an entry of
#      its own carrying a wasi-sdk toolchain, gives every package of the project
#
#        configureFlags = [
#          "--with-gcc=/nix/store/...-wasi-sdk/bin/wasm32-wasi-clang"
#          "--with-ar=/nix/store/...-wasi-sdk/bin/llvm-ar"
#          "--with-ld=/nix/store/...-wasi-sdk/bin/wasm-ld"
#          "--with-strip=/nix/store/...-wasi-sdk/bin/llvm-strip"
#        ];
#
#      and in a project for a platform without an entry, or one whose entry
#      brings no toolchain, evaluates to nothing
