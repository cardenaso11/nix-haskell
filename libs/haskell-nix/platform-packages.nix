# A haskell.nix module applying one platform's package customization. The
# driver builds a project per cross target from the same modules, so the module
# decides per evaluation which platform it is in and applies that entry, if
# there is one.
#
# `fields` are the per-package fields whose names are haskell.nix's own, so
# they can be written through verbatim. `src` is not among them: it replaces a
# value haskell.nix already has, so it is forced.
#
# Example:
#
#   import ./platform-packages.nix {
#     inherit lib fields;
#     platforms = { wasi32.packages.reflex-dom.flags.use-warp = false; };
#   }
#   => a haskell.nix module which, in the project whose target is wasm32-wasi,
#      evaluates to
#
#        config.packages.reflex-dom.flags.use-warp = false;
#
#      and in every other project, and in one where reflex-dom is not a package
#      of the project at all, to nothing
