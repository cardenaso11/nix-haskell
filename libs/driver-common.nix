# The common options mirrored under a driver's namespace. The result
# carries:
# - The declarations, hidden from the manual.
# - Seeds from the top-level values the project defined.
# - The common module's own config.
# - The pieces both drivers wire up the same way: the resolved compilers,
#   the namespaced config entries, and the driver-interface options.
#
# A driver definition overrides a seed, so a common option can be changed
# for one driver only. An option left entirely to its defaults gets no
# seed. It falls to the mirror's own declaration default, which evaluates
# against the mirror itself (`cfg`), so a default like name-from-src
# follows the driver's values.
#
# Example:
#
#   import ./driver-common.nix {
#     inherit lib pkgs cfg;
#     driver = "nixpkgs";    # names the driver in error messages
#     topConfig = config;    # a project defining packages.reflex-dom.flags.webkit2gtk
#     topOptions = options;
#   }
#   => { options = <every common option, hidden from the manual>;
#        seeds = {
#          packages.reflex-dom.flags = {          # the whole field, since
#            _type = "override";                  # `flags` is not a submodule
#            priority = 1400;                     # to descend into
#            content = { webkit2gtk = false; };
#          };
#          src = ...;                             # the project's other
#          system = ...;                          # definitions, seeded the
#          shell = ...;                           # same way
#        };
#        config = <the common module's own config>;
#        mkDriverDefault = <a definition at priority 1450>;
#        compilers = <the `compiler` option resolved per platform>;
#        mirror-config = <namespace and default compiler to config entries>;
#        interface = <per-driver payloads to the three shared options>;
#      }
#
#   `packages.reflex-dom.patches` gets no seed, nor does any other field the
#   project left alone, so a driver default still reaches it. A driver's own
#   `nixpkgs.packages.reflex-dom.flags` beats the seed. That is how a common
#   option changes for one driver only.

    # The seed rules:
    # - Seeds sit at 1400, between mkDefault (1000) and declaration defaults
    #   (1500). They are weaker than any definition and stronger than the
    #   mirror's own declaration defaults. mkOptionDefault cannot express
    #   this, because declaration defaults materialize at its priority and
    #   equal-priority definitions conflict.
    # - Only what the project defined is seeded, down to the field. A seed
    #   lands on a path exactly when some top-level definition mentions it.
    #   A driver default (mkDriverDefault, 1450) therefore still applies to
    #   every field the project left alone, however deeply nested, and yields
    #   to any field it did set. Seeding the whole of a submodule-typed
    #   option would defeat driver defaults on all of its fields as soon as
    #   one of them was defined.
    # - Declaration defaults do not count as definitions. The module system
    #   injects them at mkOptionDefault priority (1500), so a definition is
    #   one that beats 1500.
    # - Descent follows the declared sub-options, not the values, so a seed
    #   only lands where an option exists to receive it. Read-only
    #   sub-options are left out, because a read-only option set twice is an
    #   error.
    # - Reading any mirror option forces the definition priorities of every
    #   settable common option, so top-level common options must not be gated
    #   on driver config.
