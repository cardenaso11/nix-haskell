# A wasm binary put through wasm-opt and then stripped of its custom
# sections. Nothing reads those sections once the JSFFI bindings have been
# read out of them, so run the JSFFI read on the binary as linked, before
# this. The output is the file itself rather than a directory holding it,
# so a caller installs it under whatever name it wants.
#
# Example:
#
#   import ./run.nix { inherit pkgs lib; } {
#     wasm = "${frontend}/bin/frontend.wasm";
#     enable = true;
#     level = "2";
#     extraFlags = [ "-ol 2" "-s 1" "--low-memory-unused" "--strip-dwarf" "--converge" ];
#   }
#   => <derivation frontend.wasm-optimized>     # the optimized binary, the file
#                                              # itself rather than a directory
#
#   import ./run.nix { inherit pkgs lib; } {
#     wasm = "${frontend}/bin/frontend.wasm";
#     enable = false;
#     level = "2";
#     extraFlags = [];
#   }
#   => <derivation frontend.wasm-unoptimized>   # the file handed in, copied
#                                              # through, so a caller installs
#                                              # the same path either way
