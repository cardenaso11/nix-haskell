      The `ghc_wasm_jsffi.js` without which a GHC-built wasm module cannot
      be instantiated, read out of the binary by the compiler that built
      it:

      ```
      wasm-jsffi {
        ghc = config.<driver>.cross-compiler "wasi32";
        wasm = "''${frontend}/bin/frontend.wasm";
      }
      ```

      The compiler must be the one that produced the binary, and
      `<driver>.cross-compiler` names that compiler. Run this on the
      binary as linked, before `wasm-optimize` strips the sections it
      reads.
