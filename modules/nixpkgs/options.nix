      Take the project's structure (local packages, their
      directories, source-repository-packages) from the cabal
      plan of the haskell.nix driver instead of the root of the
      source. The plan is cabal's own reading of cabal.project,
      so globs, optional-packages and conditionals are exact.
      The cost is evaluating the haskell.nix toolchain (import
      from derivation). The driver still builds the packages
      from nixpkgs.

      This turns `exact-configuration` on by default. A plan
      brings in packages with version bounds this driver has no
      solver to satisfy, so reading a cabal.project needs the
      bound relief as well.

    description = ''
      Tell Cabal every direct dependency, by the id its package
      database records, and every flag the package declares. Cabal
      then resolves nothing itself and reads no version bound.

      With no bounds read, a package builds against a compiler
      released after its cabal file was written. This includes a
      bound inside a conditional stanza, which `jailbreak` cannot
      reach.

      The haskell.nix driver configures every package this way.
      That is why `allow-newer` in a cabal.project takes effect in
      that driver and not in this one.

      A flag the project states in `packages.<name>.flags` still
      wins. The generated assignments go first, and Cabal takes
      the last assignment of a flag.

      The default follows `use-plan` unless the project sets this
      option. A plan read from a cabal.project brings in the
      packages that file's `allow-newer` was written for. This
      driver has no other way past their bounds. Set the option
      explicitly to break the link, in either direction.

      It ignores version requests, since nixpkgs carries a single

      name of the package carrying it. An entry of the project's
      own replaces it.
